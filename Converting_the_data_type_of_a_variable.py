#This is to convert the data type of a variable
x=8 #Let's suppose x=8
#Now we want to convert the data type of x from being an integer variable to a string
#First, let's verify the type of variable x is
print(type(x))
#After we verify x is a numeric variable, we can convert it to string by executing:
x=str(x)
#And now, x is a string, let's verify that by executing:
print(type(x))
